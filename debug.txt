The user wants a Python function that prints 'Hello, World!'.

The user is looking for a concise and readable code snippet that meets their requirements. A simple example of such a function would be: 
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello_world()
```
This function takes no arguments and simply calls the `print` function with the desired output string.

Here's a concise and readable Python code snippet that meets the requirements:

```python
import os

# Install necessary packages if not already installed
os.system('pip3 install --quiet')

# Define the hello_world function
def hello_world():
    # Print 'Hello, World!' to the console
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the hello_world function immediately
hello_world()
```

This code snippet:

1. Installs the necessary `print` function using pip if it's not already installed.
2. Defines a concise and readable `hello_world` function that takes no arguments and prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
3. Calls the `hello_world` function immediately after defining it.

Note: Since this is a simple print statement, there's no need for a return value or any additional processing. The code snippet directly prints the desired output string.

def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
hello_world()

*** Code execution output: 

Hello, World!
